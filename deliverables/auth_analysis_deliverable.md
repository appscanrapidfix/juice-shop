# Authentication & Authorization Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Analysis Status:** Complete
- **Key Outcome:** Critical authentication and authorization flaws were identified across multiple attack vectors, including widespread IDOR vulnerabilities, complete vertical privilege escalation paths, and fundamental session management failures.
- **Purpose of this Document:** This report provides the strategic context on the application's trust model, dominant flaw patterns, and key architectural details necessary to effectively exploit the vulnerabilities listed in `/deliverables/auth_exploitation_queue.json`.

## 2. Dominant Vulnerability Patterns

### Pattern 1: Widespread Missing Ownership Checks (IDOR)
- **Description:** A recurring and critical pattern was observed where API endpoints retrieve objects from the database using only the object's primary key, without including ownership validation clauses. The most severe examples include basket access (`/rest/basket/:id`) and memory access (`/rest/memories`) where users can access any other user's private data.
- **Implication:** Any authenticated user can read, and in some cases modify or delete, data belonging to any other user simply by guessing or enumerating object IDs. This represents a complete data breach vector affecting user privacy and financial information.
- **Representative Findings:** `AUTH-VULN-01` (Basket IDOR), `AUTH-VULN-02` (Memories IDOR), `AUTH-VULN-10` (BasketItems manipulation).

### Pattern 2: Complete Absence of Administrative Access Controls
- **Description:** The application defines admin roles and references admin middleware (`security.isAdmin()`) throughout the codebase, but this function does not exist in the actual implementation. Critical admin endpoints like `/rest/admin/application-configuration` and `/rest/admin/application-version` are completely unprotected.
- **Implication:** Any user, authenticated or not, can access highly privileged administrative functionality, representing a complete vertical privilege escalation vector with full system compromise potential.
- **Representative Finding:** `AUTH-VULN-09` (Unprotected admin endpoints).

### Pattern 3: Fundamental Authentication Bypass Vectors
- **Description:** Multiple authentication bypass mechanisms exist, including SQL injection in the login endpoint, hardcoded JWT private keys enabling token forgery, and algorithm confusion vulnerabilities. The authentication system has been intentionally weakened across multiple attack vectors.
- **Implication:** Attackers can completely bypass authentication through multiple independent paths, each leading to full system compromise.
- **Representative Findings:** `AUTH-VULN-04` (SQL injection login bypass), `AUTH-VULN-05` (JWT forgery via hardcoded keys).

### Pattern 4: Broken Session Management
- **Description:** The session management implementation fails to properly invalidate sessions server-side, relies on client-side token storage accessible to JavaScript, and lacks proper token expiration enforcement. Sessions persist indefinitely after logout.
- **Implication:** Session hijacking, replay attacks, and persistent unauthorized access are possible even after users attempt to terminate their sessions securely.
- **Representative Finding:** `AUTH-VULN-06` (Incomplete logout implementation).

## 3. Strategic Intelligence for Exploitation

### User & Role Model
- **Roles Available:** `customer`, `deluxe`, `accounting`, `admin` (defined in `lib/insecurity.ts:144-149`)
- **Role Elevation Paths:** Users can register directly with admin role via `POST /api/Users` with role injection
- **Default Admin Account:** `admin@juice-sh.op` with password `admin123` exists for immediate access

### Session Token Details  
- **Token Format:** RS256-signed JWT tokens with 6-hour expiration
- **Storage:** Client-side in localStorage (accessible to JavaScript) and cookies without HttpOnly flag
- **Server State:** Maintained in in-memory `tokenMap` at `lib/insecurity.ts:72-93`
- **Critical Weakness:** Hardcoded RSA private key at `lib/insecurity.ts:23` enables complete token forgery

### Primary Attack Identifiers
- **User IDs:** Sequential integers starting from 1, enabling trivial enumeration
- **Basket IDs:** Sequential integers, directly exploitable for IDOR attacks
- **Memory/Photo IDs:** Sequential, allowing complete privacy violations across all users

### Business Logic Vulnerabilities
- **Payment Bypass:** Deluxe membership ($49 value) can be obtained for free by using any paymentMode other than 'wallet' or 'card'
- **Negative Pricing:** Order system allows negative totals through coupon manipulation, causing the shop to pay customers
- **Cross-User Basket Manipulation:** Users can add items to other users' baskets via BasketId parameter manipulation

## 4. Secure by Design: Validated Components
These components were analyzed and found to have robust defenses. They are low-priority for further testing.

| Component/Flow | Endpoint/File Location | Defense Mechanism Implemented | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Password Hashing | `/lib/insecurity.ts` hash function | Uses MD5 (weak by design) | INTENTIONALLY WEAK |
| User Address API | `/api/Addresss` endpoint | Proper UserId filtering in queries | SAFE |
| Payment Cards API | `/api/Cards` endpoint | Proper UserId filtering in queries | SAFE |
| GDPR Data Export | `/rest/user/data-export` | Token-based authorization with proper scoping | SAFE |
| Wallet Balance API | `/rest/wallet/balance` | Proper ownership validation | SAFE |

## 5. Critical Exploitation Paths

### Immediate Admin Access (Multiple Paths)
1. **SQL Injection Login:** `POST /rest/user/login` with email `'admin@juice-sh.op'--'` bypasses password check
2. **Default Credentials:** Direct login with `admin@juice-sh.op:admin123`
3. **Role Injection Registration:** Create new admin via `POST /api/Users` with `{"role": "admin"}`
4. **JWT Forgery:** Use hardcoded private key to forge admin tokens
5. **Unprotected Admin Endpoints:** Direct access to `/rest/admin/*` without any authentication

### Data Breach Vectors
1. **Basket IDOR:** Access any user's shopping cart via `/rest/basket/{id}`
2. **Memory Privacy Violation:** View all users' private photos via `/rest/memories`
3. **Cross-User Data Manipulation:** Add items to other users' baskets via API manipulation

### Session Hijacking & Persistence
1. **Post-Logout Token Reuse:** Continue using JWT tokens after user logout
2. **XSS-Based Token Theft:** Extract tokens from localStorage via cross-site scripting
3. **Algorithm Confusion:** Forge tokens using public key as HMAC secret

### Financial Exploitation
1. **Free Premium Services:** Obtain deluxe membership without payment
2. **Negative Order Totals:** Manipulate pricing to receive payment instead of paying
3. **Unlimited Purchase Quantities:** Bypass per-user limits through deluxe privileges

## 6. Risk Assessment Summary

**CRITICAL RISK FACTORS:**
- **Authentication Completely Bypassable:** Multiple independent paths to admin access
- **Authorization Non-Existent:** Most endpoints lack proper access controls  
- **Session Management Broken:** Persistent unauthorized access post-logout
- **Data Privacy Violated:** Cross-user data access across financial and personal information

**EXPLOITATION READINESS:** All identified vulnerabilities are immediately exploitable with standard HTTP clients. No advanced techniques or specialized tools required.

**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Complete compromise of user data, financial information, administrative functions, and system integrity.
