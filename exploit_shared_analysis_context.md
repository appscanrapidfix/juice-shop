### SQLi Specialist Findings

* **Critical Credential Compromise:** Successfully extracted admin credentials through authentication bypass:
  - Admin Email: `admin@juice-sh.op`
  - MD5 Password Hash: `01920223a7bbd73250516f069df18b500`
  - Valid JWT Token: `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...` (truncated)
  - These credentials should be tested against all authentication interfaces by the Auth Exploitation specialist.

* **Database Architecture Confirmed:** Live testing revealed dual-database architecture:
  - SQLite 3 database for user authentication and product data
  - MongoDB database for order tracking functionality
  - This confirms the pre-reconnaissance analysis and provides attack surface for other specialists.

* **Error Disclosure Patterns:** All vulnerable endpoints return detailed database error messages without sanitization:
  - SQLite: Returns full syntax error messages with query structure hints
  - MongoDB: Returns JavaScript evaluation results in JSON responses
  - Other specialists should leverage this verbose error reporting for their exploitation attempts.

* **Input Sanitization Weakness:** Observed minimal input validation across injection points:
  - No WAF or advanced filtering detected during extensive payload testing
  - Only basic length truncation (200 chars) on search endpoint
  - XSS specialist should expect similar weak input validation on client-side attack vectors.

* **JWT Token Structure:** Successfully extracted JWT reveals RSA256 signing with potentially hardcoded keys:
  - Algorithm: RS256
  - Contains full user profile data in payload
  - Auth specialist should investigate token manipulation and signing key extraction.
