# Shared Analysis Context

## Key Findings for Subsequent Specialists

- **Server Status During Analysis:** The Juice Shop application server was not running on localhost:3001 during SQL injection analysis, preventing live defensive behavior testing. Future specialists should verify server availability before dynamic testing.

- **Confirmed Backend Technologies:** 
  - Primary database is SQLite 3 (file-based at `data/juiceshop.sqlite`)
  - Secondary MongoDB instance used for order tracking functionality
  - Node.js/Express.js application with TypeScript
  - Sequelize ORM used for most database operations

- **Input Sanitization Patterns Observed:**
  - The User model (models/user.ts) implements conditional HTML sanitization using either `security.sanitizeLegacy()` or `security.sanitizeSecure()` based on challenge flags
  - XSS sanitization functions available in lib/insecurity.ts: `sanitizeHtml()`, `sanitizeLegacy()`, `sanitizeSecure()`
  - Challenge-dependent code paths exist that may bypass sanitization when certain flags are enabled

- **Defensive Architecture Notes:**
  - Most endpoints use Sequelize ORM operations which provide inherent protection against SQL injection
  - Only 3 endpoints bypass ORM protections: `/rest/user/login`, `/rest/products/search`, `/rest/track-order/:id`
  - Input validation is generally minimal - primarily length truncation and basic regex filtering

- **Error Handling Behavior:**
  - Application returns detailed error messages to clients, including raw database errors
  - Error disclosure could be valuable for XSS injection points and information gathering

- **Authentication & Session Management:**
  - JWT tokens with hardcoded RSA keys (lib/insecurity.ts:23)
  - In-memory token storage in `authenticatedUsers.tokenMap`
  - Session data accessible via security.authenticatedUsers.from(req)

- **Notable Endpoints for XSS Analysis:**
  - `/rest/user/whoami` implements JSONP functionality (potential JSONP injection)
  - User profile endpoints with image upload functionality
  - Feedback system (`/api/Feedbacks`) mentioned in recon as XSS vulnerable
  - Challenge system with dynamic content rendering

- **XSS Specialist:** Focus on the conditional sanitization logic in User model and challenge-dependent code paths that may bypass normal protections

## XSS Analysis Results (For AuthBypass Specialist)

- **JWT Token Storage:** Confirmed that JWT tokens are stored in browser localStorage (`security.authenticatedUsers.tokenMap`) and are accessible to JavaScript - vulnerable to XSS-based token theft

- **Session Cookie Security:** Primary session mechanisms lack HttpOnly flags, making them accessible via `document.cookie` in XSS attacks

- **Critical XSS Vectors Confirmed:**
  - DOM-based XSS in search functionality (tested and working)
  - Stored XSS via feedback system when challenge flags enabled 
  - JSONP injection in `/rest/user/whoami` for cross-domain data exfiltration
  - Server-Side Template Injection in username field allowing RCE

- **Challenge Flag Dependencies:** Authentication bypass testing should consider that many vulnerabilities require specific challenge flags to be enabled:
  - `persistedXssFeedbackChallenge` - disables feedback sanitization
  - `persistedXssUserChallenge` - disables user profile sanitization
  - `usernameXssChallenge` - enables SSTI in username field

- **Profile Management Security:** 
  - Profile image URL uploads can inject CSP directives for policy bypass
  - Username field supports Node.js code execution via eval() when conditions met
  - User email field bypasses sanitization under certain challenge conditions

- **Administrative Interface Exposure:**
  - Admin panel at `/administration` renders user feedback with bypassed Angular sanitization
  - Admin users are vulnerable to stored XSS when viewing user-submitted content
  - Potential privilege escalation vector via XSS against admin users

- **Recommended AuthBypass Focus Areas:**
  - JWT secret key hardcoding patterns (lib/insecurity.ts:23)
  - In-memory token storage bypass techniques
  - Challenge flag manipulation for authentication bypasses
  - SSTI capabilities in username field for potential privilege escalation

- **AuthBypass Specialist:** Investigate the hardcoded JWT keys and in-memory token storage patterns for potential authentication bypass techniques
