# Shared Analysis Context

## Key Findings for Subsequent Specialists

- **Server Status During Analysis:** The Juice Shop application server was not running on localhost:3001 during SQL injection analysis, preventing live defensive behavior testing. Future specialists should verify server availability before dynamic testing.

- **Confirmed Backend Technologies:** 
  - Primary database is SQLite 3 (file-based at `data/juiceshop.sqlite`)
  - Secondary MongoDB instance used for order tracking functionality
  - Node.js/Express.js application with TypeScript
  - Sequelize ORM used for most database operations

- **Input Sanitization Patterns Observed:**
  - The User model (models/user.ts) implements conditional HTML sanitization using either `security.sanitizeLegacy()` or `security.sanitizeSecure()` based on challenge flags
  - XSS sanitization functions available in lib/insecurity.ts: `sanitizeHtml()`, `sanitizeLegacy()`, `sanitizeSecure()`
  - Challenge-dependent code paths exist that may bypass sanitization when certain flags are enabled

- **Defensive Architecture Notes:**
  - Most endpoints use Sequelize ORM operations which provide inherent protection against SQL injection
  - Only 3 endpoints bypass ORM protections: `/rest/user/login`, `/rest/products/search`, `/rest/track-order/:id`
  - Input validation is generally minimal - primarily length truncation and basic regex filtering

- **Error Handling Behavior:**
  - Application returns detailed error messages to clients, including raw database errors
  - Error disclosure could be valuable for XSS injection points and information gathering

- **Authentication & Session Management:**
  - JWT tokens with hardcoded RSA keys (lib/insecurity.ts:23)
  - In-memory token storage in `authenticatedUsers.tokenMap`
  - Session data accessible via security.authenticatedUsers.from(req)

- **Notable Endpoints for XSS Analysis:**
  - `/rest/user/whoami` implements JSONP functionality (potential JSONP injection)
  - User profile endpoints with image upload functionality
  - Feedback system (`/api/Feedbacks`) mentioned in recon as XSS vulnerable
  - Challenge system with dynamic content rendering

- **XSS Specialist:** Focus on the conditional sanitization logic in User model and challenge-dependent code paths that may bypass normal protections
- **AuthBypass Specialist:** Investigate the hardcoded JWT keys and in-memory token storage patterns for potential authentication bypass techniques
